# Antonia's Technical Writing Portfolio

##### Last Updated: 2024-07-28

## ðŸ“„ Overview

Thank you for taking the time to review and show interest in my technical writing portfolio.

Let me introduce myself: I am Antonia Chela and I currently live and work in South Africa. I am half-Zambian, half-Ghanaian  and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Anthropology and Archaeology at the University of South Africa. 

I have recently transitioned my professional interest and activities towards technical writing currently I have limited experience but I am hoping to change that. I created this portfolio to showcase my current skills with intent to develop it as I learn more.

The writing samples I have included are a how-to guide, a recommendation report and a user guide. I wish to update this page with more information as I progress.

I hope this insight into my technical writing portfolio will provide you some assurance of my technical writing skills. Please have a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniachela).

Thank you!

**Antonia**
